Polling System using RPCs
-------------------------

CIS 505: Software Systems
Homework 2 Part II
Submitted by: Rohit Dureja

Steps involved to run system using RPC

1. use make to compile all files. "make all"

2. in a terminal window, run the server using
	./poll_server

3. in a seperate terminal window, run the client using
	./poll_client <address> -options

Instead of step 3, a script has been provided which can be run to simulate a voting scenario. To run the script, after step 2, run
	chmod u+rx script
	./script
NOTE: In running from the script, I am getting a "segmentation fault" warning but the program is working fine. I didn't get time to rectify that problem. Sorry about that.

4. stop server and clean up using make. "make clean"
